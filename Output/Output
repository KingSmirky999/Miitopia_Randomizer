This file is here to ensure the Output folder is made for the github. I am bad at coding.
All of the files you will use to mod the randomizer into Miitopia will be here.

Use the custom "enemy.sarc" if you are playing on Console/Ryujinx to ensure faceless boss enemies
won't spawn (which cause crashes).

Might still cause crashes later on with certain boss cutscenes. If so, delete the enemy.sarc to get past those
cutscenes and then re add it after.
